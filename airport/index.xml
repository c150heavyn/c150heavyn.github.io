      <description>&lt;p&gt;Several restaurants are within walking distance across the street to the north.   Recommend Marty&amp;rsquo;s Steakhouse (supper club).   I haven&amp;rsquo;t had to use the courtesy car but supposedly there is one available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two restaurants are within walking distance north of the field.  The Edgewater Supper Club is a unique place with great food and classic supper club vibes. Lou&amp;rsquo;s Riverview only has bar food / frozen pizzas, not recommended for food but a great patio and view.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Great airport with new pilot&amp;rsquo;s lounge and lookout deck.   Two courtesy cars are available in a heated garage (call ahead to get garage code).   Highly recommend the &lt;a href=&#34;https://driftlesscafe.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Driftless Cafe&lt;/a&gt; owned by Chef Luke Zahm (&amp;ldquo;Wisconsin Foodie&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Frequent destination primarily for the Black Angus Supper Club which is right across the street from the airport with great food. If you hop in the car, The Barn Restaurant is a unique place to eat.  There is also a liquor store down the street for importing of indigenous Wisconsin beer.  Cabella&amp;rsquo;s no longer will reimburse taxi rides here but the casino will pick you up in the shuttle. Courtesy car is now available via lockbox as of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The FBO has been completely remodeled - if you remember the older owners who sold the canned goods, the old FBO and all the goodies they sold are no longer there.   The new FBO is very nice with cheap snacks available for purchase and comfortable couches and a TV.   Two courtesy cars are available with after hours access and two e-bikes are also available.  This is a neat location right next to the the Wisconsin river.  There were several establishments open on a Sunday, &lt;a href=&#34;http://old61diner.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Old 61 Diner&lt;/a&gt; was good and popular with the locals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Craving Indian cuisine after your flight? I-80 Dhabi is a convenient 10-15 minute walk south from the airport. For even more dining options, explore downtown Grinnel using the airport&amp;rsquo;s courtesy car (accessible after-hours).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2024: Courtesy car (ex-police Ford Explorer) keys in the FBO &lt;br&gt; Good lounge with snacks and clean bathrooms.  Great downtown area with a variety of shops &amp;amp; restaurants.  Be sure to go to the downtown area vs. the surrounding residential area.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Smooth grass strip with Babe&amp;rsquo;s Steakhouse an easy &amp;frac34; mile walk away for some great prime rib.   Call the airport manager for strip conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The runway was re-asphalted and several hangars at the airport were revamped to give the airport an overall fresher look.   Walk north 0.8m to the Green Valley Getaway or 0.8m south to main street with several places to eat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Toppling Goliath brewpub moved across the street from the airport within walking distance offering food and to-go beers.  Decorah offers alot for such a small city.  Took the new bike loop around the city and was able to visit most of the major sites including the fish hatchery, Pulpit Rock campground and eagle&amp;rsquo;s nest (near fish hatchery).   Airport not attended sunday (no courtesy car on sundays), bike rental, trout hatchery, wifi available in lounge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Grass strip right next to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://orchardlandingfarm.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Orchard Landing Apple Farm&lt;/a&gt; retail store, beautiful place to fly to in the Fall time. The runway is 18/36 and 2900&amp;rsquo; X 100&amp;rsquo; and very smooth relative to most grass strips. It does slope slightly to the south but it&amp;rsquo;s easy to land in either direction.  If you are concerned about takeoff roll,  the south departure is downhill and the terrain falls away quickly past the threshold.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cattleman&amp;rsquo;s Steak House is an easy walk across the street from the airport and is located above the clubhouse of the golf course - great food with nightly specials.   Pilot-in-command gets a free appetizer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nicely kept basic pilot lounge with clean bathrooms and a free-will-donation snack and drink selection.    They used to have a courtesy car but it is out indefinitely due to maintenance issues.   You can still call city hall during government business hours for a ride, instructions are posted in the lounge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pella doesn&amp;rsquo;t mess around with keeping its Dutch heritage alive and well.   Lots of examples of Dutch heritage and plenty of places to eat or get coffee/baked goods. Recommend Jaarsma Bakery. The airport will shuttle people into town during Pella Tulip Days in the spring time.   Anytime of year, take one of the two courtesy vans into the walkable town center and you can easily spend a half-day checking out the scenery, shops, and bakeries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Multiple courtesy cars available that need to be arranged during business hours.  Plenty of restaurants and things to do near the waterfront, the button museum is worth a visit.  In the past,  there have been restaurants within walking distance of the field but there isn&amp;rsquo;t one in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Monroe downtown square (swiss restaurants, chocolate, cheese, etc),  Minhas Brewery and Distillery tours and shop (cheap beer and liquor).  Call ahead to airport manager and he will put free taxi vouchers in the cabinet in the bathroom.  Without the vouchers,  the cab ride is $7-$12 each way depending on number of passengers.  Monroe County Cheese Days every 2 years on the even year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was a restaurant (Duffy Slades) about &amp;frac34; mile walk west on the road but appears to be closed now.     The restaurant seems to change hands often - check the internet before travelling.  Nicely done new FBO building in 2021 with lounge and self-serve snacks.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cassville offers a scenic and challenging airport to fly into.  Extra caution is necessary with low powered or loaded aircraft (use all the runway).  There is a restaurant on each end of the runway right across the railroad tracks.     The tiny pilot lounge and porta-potty on the east end of the airport while a city park is near the west end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lacon is a small river town with a nice airport.  There is a restaurant across the field called Kenyon&amp;rsquo;s Place which has a nice 70&amp;rsquo;s feel on the inside with old fashioned (but cheap) food.  It is worth a visit.  Took the courtesy car into the small downtown area which had a coffee / gift shop.  There&amp;rsquo;s not much going on near the river.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no obvious courtesy car on the island but if you call Motion to Go they will give you a ride in town.  Since most of the island is accessible by bike, its worth renting a bike or moped.  Big Bay state park is worth a visit.  Pick up fuel in Ashland (KASX) as there are no fuel services on the island.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ellen Church Field is unattended and  no courtesy cars are available.   The Cresco town center, where there are several restaurants, is about a 1 mile walk from the airport.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nothing noteable.  Flew in on the memorial day weekend and Peoria was dead.  There&amp;rsquo;s several good places to eat and the normal amenities of a mid-sized Midwest city.  Ate at One World Cafe which was good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Centerville airport is the closest airport to Rathbun lake (Honey Creek Resort).  The airport has 2 courtesy cars and they do permit the 30 minute drive to the resort.  The resort is quiet but does have a marina with boat and jet ski rentals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heartland Aviation provided use of the courtesy car.  State park in the area has a surprisingly nice zoo.  Leinenkugel&amp;rsquo;s Leinie&amp;rsquo;s lodge is worth a stop for beer samples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Flew in for Airventure 2010 which turned out to be relatively painless - just stay relaxed.  Be sure to monitor the status of the a/c parking and campgrounds before flying in.  We flew in on Friday morning and the traffic was light. Airventure, EAA museum&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Flew in to Burlington after finding out the courtesy car at Keokuk was MIA.  Late 80&amp;rsquo;s courtesy car was available and successfully navigated snake alley.  Catfish Bend casino and Fun City are right next to each other.  Several restaurants can be found near the river.  Fun City, Catfish bend, Big Muddys (restaruant on river).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a fun airport to fly into as it has a TSA security checkpoint for commercial flights right next to the general aviation entrance.  Rental cars and courtesy car are available to take to the lake (Clear Lake).  Jet ski rentals and several restaurants are located on the lake.  Buddy Holly memorial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Private - land on an island.  Flew in to Abel Island for annual fly-in.  This was a unique experience landing on an island in the middle of the Mississippi.  It is private so normally requires permission but was not required for the fly-in.   Nothing notable for visitors when the fly-in is not happening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Check the NOTAMs for this airport before landing to make sure it is still open runway is safe.  Runway was being overcome by grass and concrete was not in the best condition.  Walk across the street to the resort which has golf and water sport (jet ski / kayak rentals).    Restaurant &amp;amp; deli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kewanee has a neat Pilot&amp;rsquo;s lounge worthy of a fuel stop.  Took the courtesy car to downtown to visit Good&amp;rsquo;s furniture store.  There is not much else going on downtown.  The restaurant in the basement of Good&amp;rsquo;s was surprisingly decent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Read NOTAMs for noise abatement procedures before arriving.  Mustard Museum is worth visiting.  5th Street Diner has good food and specializes in pies.  Capital Brewing company is nearby.   Courtesy car and rentals available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Winona offers a scenic approach in a river valley.  Supposedly there is an ice cream shop around the airport but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it.  There is no courtesy car so took a taxi into the downtown area which was small but had a variety of restaurants and coffee shops.  Without a courtesy car its not worth much of a visit.  No courtesy car, taxi only, scenic approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Schaumburg is about the closest non-towered airport to downtown Chicago.  If you aren&amp;rsquo;t going into town, Pilot Pete&amp;rsquo;s restaurant is located on-field. If you are going into the city, Hertz and Enterprise offer drop-offs at the airport.  Tiedown was $10/night but was waived with fuel purchase.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Flew in to Fond Du Lac as a stepping stone to getting into Airventure (Oshkosh, WI).  Fond Du Lac has a convienient shuttle system that frequently shuttles pilots into Airventure.   They were selling parking tie-downs if you didn&amp;rsquo;t pack any.  We arrived at 10am and parking was easy.  Air traffic was hardly noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good destination (class D airspace) w/ choice of 2 brand-new courtesy cars to take into town.  Paperwork says there is a 2 hour limit but its likely not enforced.  Downtown Dubuque has several decent restaurants and Diamond Jo Casino.   River Museum, Greyhound park.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whiteside County airport is right off of I-80 and I recognized it immediately upon driving into the town.  It is a common place for travelers to stop on I-80.  The downtown area of Sterling had a few shops including a decent chocolatier.  There were mostly chain restaurants but Arthur&amp;rsquo;s deli was good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Flew in to Clow International for the weekend.  Coordination of rental car was easy.  There appears to be an on-field restaurant named Charlie&amp;rsquo;s (didn&amp;rsquo;t eat here).  As expected, the airspace is busy.  Mini-golf course right outside airport grounds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
